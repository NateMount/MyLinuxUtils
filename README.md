# MyLinuxUtils

A repo of my personal linux utilities

Note : These are simple commands that could most likely be aliased in your bashrc

### CLS
Simple command I use for expediated workflow by combining a clear command with an immediate ls to show current directory

### Profile
Command that can be used with Konsole to switch between profiles in the command line [ Note : Will open new window ]

### Brave
Command that will open a window for the brave browser
